### Lab#1

~In preparation for Lab # 1, my group decided to create a game that we would like to develop if money and time were no object. Initially when we got into our Zoom breakout room the first couple of minutes felt hectic because there were so many people, and everyone wanted their voices to be heard. A group leader had not yet been established, and we barely knew each other. One of the most helpful initial actions, which helped us get better organized, was that someone in the group created and shared a google doc where we could brainstorm our ideas in real time. The doc was a helpful addition because it not only allowed us to write down ideas and remember them, but the people who were too intimidated to speak up could simply jot down their ideas while others were talking. I myself felt as though there were already too many voices speaking up via the microphone, so I started creating some list headers for actionable items I felt we would eventually need to discuss. This helped create an agenda and organize thoughts, whereas previously thoughts and ideas were kindof all over the place. 

~During the discussion there were times when it was clear that someone else had more experience in a certain subject, and with this confidence I noticed that people who had previously been quieter were speaking up. For example, where we were discussing different weaponry objects that could potentially be created, some of the girls in the group (including myself) stayed quieter, however, as soon as the conversation turned to discussing QA, those who were contributing the most with regards to weaponry features were now listening to someone else talk. This uncovered that in reality a group can have people with a variety of strengths, and rather than focusing on where oneâ€™s shortcomings are within the group (especially compared to someone else), it made more sense to focus on where your personal strengths could be. As we continued to speak and brainstorm it became clear that there were a lot of smart and talented people in the group, but that their skill sets and knowledge bases varied. This type of diversity would actually be beneficial to a team, as when there is a lot to get done, the best way to tackle the project is to divide and conquer; assigning each person an objective that falls underneath their specific skill set. 

~The game that we came up with would be a Flash Game (a browser game), and would be called MAREEO Shooting With Them (a play on a combination of Mario, Club Penguin, and Among Us). The group was able to agree on this name because we all found it funny, and liked that it was a play on several gaming concepts we were all familiar with, and overall we found that creating such a game would be hilarious, and nostalgic for many (the end user as well). 

~Instead of wondering where to begin with creating such a game and talking endlessly about it, we decided to break down the various components into a list. We would need; sprites (character models / assets), gameplay, a story, PR (to attract players), a UI/UX team, QA (quality assurance), and a functional ability to perform in game transactions.As our ideas progressed and we made more and more decisions, still certain people continued to speak out more than others. I think this phenomenon can occur often in big groups, as the people in those groups will almost always have different levels of comfort when it comes to speaking in large groups. Whereas, if we had broken up into smaller sub-groups, I believe those people might have felt more empowered to speak up and contribute as much as others. 

~Ultimately, there were no big arguments or disagreements, and it seemed as though everyone got to contribute at least something to the discussion, and no one was left totally out of the brainstorming. There were challenges, especially at first, some of which were related directly to being on Zoom (rather than in person), but mostly because working in large groups is always tough, but especially when those people are new to you. Lucky for us, everyone was very polite and respectful of others. 

~All in all, if we were hypothetically forced to continue working in this group for the remainder of the semester I think we would all make it work, and would even be surprised with how much we can accomplish together; especially when we all have the mutual goals of learning something new, advancing our careers, and doing well in the class.
